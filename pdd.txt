🔥 Wildfire Prediction MVP — Product Definition Document (PDD)

Version: 1.0
Owner: Pratham
Timeline: 1 Month (4 Weeks)

1. Product Overview

The Wildfire Prediction MVP is a web-based system that allows a user to view recent satellite imagery of a region, run an AI model that predicts wildfire risk or highlights possible fire regions, and visualize the output as a heatmap overlay on a map.
This MVP does not aim for production-level accuracy — only a functional end-to-end pipeline.

2. Core Goal for MVP

Build a working prototype that:

Accepts a location/region from user.

Retrieves or accepts satellite image input.

Sends it to an AI inference API.

Returns a predicted fire-risk heatmap or fire/ burned area segmentation mask.

Displays it as an overlay on a web map.

3. Target Users (for MVP)

Students & researchers experimenting with wildfire AI.

Emergency enthusiasts / demo audiences.

Hackathon / portfolio reviewers.

4. MVP Features (Strict Scope)
4.1 Frontend (React + Tailwind + Leaflet/Mapbox)

✔ Map interface with:

Search box to choose a location

View satellite imagery (static tiles or uploaded image)

Button: “Predict Fire Risk”

✔ Overlay support:

Display AI-predicted heatmap/mask on top of map

Basic opacity slider

✔ Minimal UI pages:

Home (map + prediction)

About the project

4.2 Backend (Node/Express or FastAPI)

✔ API Endpoints:

POST /predict → Input: region coordinates OR uploaded tile

GET /health → Service health check

✔ Orchestrates model inference by:

Passing image → Python AI inference script

Returning model output (image mask as base64 or PNG)

✔ Logs each prediction request (MongoDB or simple folder logs).

4.3 AI Model (Python + PyTorch)

✔ Simple segmentation or classification model:

Model type: U-Net or small CNN

Task: Detect fire / burned areas on small satellite patches

Trained on open-source datasets (Sentinel-2 patches, Fire datasets)

Achieve “reasonable” patterns, not accuracy perfection

✔ Steps included:

Preprocess satellite images to 256×256

Train model locally/Colab for a few epochs

Export to .pt file

Inference script taking input → returns mask

Basic thresholding into heatmap

4.4 Data (for MVP)

✔ Use publicly available imagery:

Google Earth Engine export OR

Open wildfire datasets from Kaggle / UNSPIDER

✔ No live streaming, no IoT integration (later phase).

5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope for 1 Month)

❌ Real-time satellite feed integration
❌ Multi-sensor IoT fusion
❌ High-accuracy predictions
❌ Deploying mobile apps
❌ Complex authentication
❌ GPU-powered cloud scaling
❌ Custom-trained large models

6. Tech Stack (Finalized)
Frontend

React + Vite

Tailwind CSS

Leaflet.js (open-source)

Backend

Node/Express (simple) OR FastAPI (better for ML)

Python inference engine

MongoDB (optional)

ML/AI

PyTorch

U-Net backbone

Earth Engine/Sentinel-2 dataset exports

Deployment

Frontend → Vercel/Netlify

Backend → Render.com / Railway.app

Model → In same backend (CPU inference)

7. System Architecture (High Level)

React Frontend → calls
Express/FastAPI Backend → loads
PyTorch Model → returns
Mask prediction → Frontend overlays as heatmap

Flow:
User selects area → Backend fetches image → Python model predicts → Backend returns → UI overlays.

8. Detailed Timeline (1 Month Plan)
📌 Week 1 — Foundations

Set up GitHub repo + project structure

Build basic React frontend with map (Leaflet)

Implement search + region selection

Learn Earth Engine and export sample tiles

Prepare dataset for model training

Deliverable: Map UI + sample images ready.

📌 Week 2 — AI Model

Implement U-Net/U-Net-small in PyTorch

Train model on sample wildfire/burn datasets

Create inference script: predict(image.png) → mask.png

Export trained model checkpoint

Deliverable: Working inference script producing heatmaps.

📌 Week 3 — Backend Integration

Build FastAPI backend

Create /predict endpoint

Integrate Python inference

Handle uploads / region-based retrieval

Test end-to-end on local machine

Deliverable: Frontend button triggers real model prediction.

📌 Week 4 — Final App + Deployment

Add mask overlay + opacity slider

Add loading states + error handling

Deploy frontend + backend

Clean up UI

Test on multiple sample regions

Write README + presentation slides

Deliverable: Fully deployed MVP.

9. Success Metrics (for MVP)

End-to-end prediction works in < 6–10 seconds

Mask overlay loads properly 90% of the time

Model provides visually meaningful hotspot detection

App works on desktop browsers reliably

Deployment links ready for portfolio/demo

10. Risks & Mitigation
Risk	Mitigation
Model accuracy is low	Use simple U-Net + more data augmentation
Satellite tiles hard to fetch	Pre-export fixed dataset from GEE
Backend slow on CPU	Downscale images to 256×256
Deployment errors	Deploy frontend + backend separately
Time overruns	Stick to MVP scope strictly
11. Future Expansion (Post-MVP)

IoT sensor integration

Fire spread prediction (time-series models)

Better data pipelines (live satellite feed)

Larger models (UNet++, ResNet-UNet, Segformer)

User accounts + saved regions

Mobile app

Admin panel for risk reports
