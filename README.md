Wildfire Prediction MVP

This project is an experimental MVP that predicts wildfire risk using satellite data, a lightweight ML model, and simulated IoT sensor data. The goal is to learn how to combine machine learning, data ingestion, and a full-stack web application.

Features

-Fetch sample satellite or hotspot data

-Run a basic wildfire prediction model

-Simulate IoT sensor data (temperature, smoke, humidity)

-Backend API to serve predictions and sensor data

-Frontend dashboard that displays fire risk on a map

Tech Stack

Frontend: React (Vite), TailwindCSS
Backend: Node.js or Python, Express/FastAPI
Database: MongoDB (optional)
ML: Simple segmentation/classification model
